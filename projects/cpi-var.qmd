format: html
---

## Project Overview

This project focuses on building and refining Vector Autoregressive (VAR) models for forecasting the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) using related economic indicators. It includes a comparison of VAR specifications, evaluation of forecast accuracy, model diagnostics, and presentation of a final "champion model" selected based on information criteria and residual analysis.

- **Tools:** R (vars, tseries, forecast), Quarto, ggplot2
- **Skills:** VAR lag selection, impulse response analysis, model stability checks, residual diagnostics
- **Deliverables:**
