## Project Overview

This project compares supervised and unsupervised machine learning approaches using a customer churn dataset. The unsupervised portion uses k-means and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) for behavioral clustering, while the supervised side builds tree-based models to predict churn probability. The analysis also includes PCA-based dimensionality reduction and visualization techniques to evaluate separability between churn groups.
